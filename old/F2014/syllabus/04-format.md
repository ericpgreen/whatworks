You will have the first week of the semester to read the first book on our list, "Down and Out in Paris and London". We'll discuss the book in class on Tuesday September 2 and work on an in-class assignment related to the book on Thursday September 4. We'll discuss our second book, "Behind the Beautiful Forevers", and complete an in-class activity the following Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. This will be our format all semester. Book discussion on Tuesday, in-class activity on Thursday.

Each book is on reserve at Perkins Library for overnight checkout. Two of the books are available through Duke as eBooks. The cost of the other nine on Amazon Kindle is currently just under $100. You do not need to own a Kindle, smartphone, or tablet to read Kindle books; you can read Kindle books in your computer's browser (Cloud Reader) or in the desktop app.
