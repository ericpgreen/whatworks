# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## How can we contact you?

Posting to Facebook is almost always the best option for asking a class-related question. I'm likely to reply quickly because everyone benefits from the post. If you need a quick answer to something that does not impact others, call or text. Otherwise, send an email.

## What are your office hours?

Office hours vary by week. It's best just to let me know you want to meet and we will find a time that works. Skype is always an option if we can't meet in person.

## May I use electronic devices during class?

You may use devices during in-class activities (when needed), but not during book discussions. Of course, if you purchase ebooks for the course, then you may use a device to access the book during class. No other use during book discussions will be permitted.

## Is it OK to record class sessions?

You are free to create recordings in class that aid your learning, but only on non-book discussion days (see above). This does not give you permission to share or distribute these recordings. Know that for all of your classes, the speaker holds the copyright to the lecture, and you must get the speaker’s written permission to distribute this content. And you have to consider individual privacy rights of your classmates.[ This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbA7AGOTlCg) produced by Duke’s Scholarly Communications Office gives a short overview of the issues.
