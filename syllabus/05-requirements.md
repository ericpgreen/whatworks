# COURSE REQUIREMENTS

## Class Participation (30%)

The participation grade will be determined by your attendance and contributions to class activities (see [Duke's definition of a seminar](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/seminars)). You should be prepared to comment on every reading in case I decide to call on you in class. I will incorporate pop quizzes and other assignments if I feel there is a need to further incentivize students to keep up with the readings.

You are permitted 2 unexcused absences throughout the semester. Beyond that, each unexcused absence will result in your overall grade being lowered by 1-step (e.g., A+ to A). Coming late to class counts as 0.5 unexcused absences. 

Officially, Duke permits students to miss work due to absence from class in four circumstances: illness; personal emergencies; religious observance; and varsity athletic participation. Please take a moment to [read](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/class-attendance-and-missed-work) how Duke defines each circumstance. Missed work associated with any other absence is not covered by this policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Book Discussion and Activity (30%)

Students will be divided into three teams of six. Each team will be responsible for leading a discussion (Tuesdays) and creating an activity (Thursdays) for (3) books.

## Reading Reflections (20%)

Students will submit 6 reading reflections over the course of the semester. Reflections may not be submitted for books covered by the student's team. I will grade 2 of your 6 submissions. To get full credit, you must submit all 6 reflections on time. Reflections will be due Mondays at 5pm ET.

## Final Paper (20%)

There is no final exam scheduled for finals week. Instead, students will be expected to submit a final paper by 10pm ET on Thursday December 15. Students will select topics prior to the Thanksgiving break.

I encourage you to consult the Writing Studio when you are preparing your final. In addition to offering 1-on-1 consultations, the Writing Studio also publishes [helpful resources](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources) that will help you to improve your drafts, such as [this collection](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources/working-with-sources) on working with sources. Avoid plagiarism and [know when to quote (rarely) and when to paraphrase (often)](http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/quotations.original.pdf). If you do not use a citation manager, you should, and the library can help you get started.
