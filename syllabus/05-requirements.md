# COURSE REQUIREMENTS

## Class Participation (50%)

Your participation grade will be determined by your attendance and contributions to class activities. You should be prepared to comment on every reading in case I decide to call on you in class. I will incorporate pop quizzes and other assignments if I feel there is a need to further incentivize students to keep up with the readings.

You are permitted 2 unexcused absences throughout the semester. Beyond that, each unexcused absence will result in your grade being lowered by 1-step (e.g., A+ to A). Coming late to class counts as 0.5 unexcused absences. You are responsible for [tracking missed classes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5Bm_Cg7JTYCmNrr4DY4lz93WPuY3w0L4f2pM4fhn9U/edit?usp=sharing); all inputs on the honor system.

Officially, Duke permits students to miss work due to absence from class in four circumstances: illness; personal emergencies; religious observance; and varsity athletic participation. Please take a moment to [read](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/missing-work-classes) how Duke defines each circumstance. Missed work associated with any other absence is not covered by this policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Oral Exam (25%)

Your midterm will be a 9-minute oral exam during class time on October 7 or 9 (private meetings every 10 minutes). I will ask you three questions. You will have 3-minutes to answer each question, and you may skip one question. I will evaluate each answer on a 0-5 scale. I will drop your lowest score, so total scores can range from 0 to 10. Skipping a question will not count as your lowest score.

## Final Exam (25%)

Your final exam is scheduled for Sunday December 14 from 7-10pm ET. Since this is the last possible exam slot, this will be take-home exam. It will be due at 10pm sharp on the 14th as per Duke policy on take-home finals. I will give you a copy of the exam with instructions for submission on our last day of class. The exam will be graded out of 100 points. You will lose 5 points for a late submission and 2 additional points for every hour after the deadline. For instance, if you submit your exam at 10:01pm ET, you will lose 5 points. If you submit at 11:00pm, you will lose 7 points. And so on.

I encourage you to consult the Writing Studio when you are preparing your final. In addition to offering 1-on-1 consultations, the Writing Studio also publishes [helpful resources](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources) that will help you to improve your drafts, such as [this collection](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources/working-with-sources) on working with sources. Avoid plagiarism and [know when to quote (rarely) and when to paraphrase (often)](http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/quotations.original.pdf). If you do not use a citation manager, you should, and the library can help you get started.
