# COURSE DESCRIPTION

Incomes are stagnant in many parts of the world, and the gap between the rich and poor has never been greater. Every year, more than 6 million children die before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable causes. More than 35 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, and one million die every year. In 2014, there will likely be more than 200 million cases of malaria and more than 8 million new cases of TB. One billion people live in extreme poverty.

Over the past few decades, the rich world has transferred approximately 2 trillion in aid to developing countries. Has it all been a waste? Money thrown down "Third word rat-holes"? Or has this money been woefully inadequate? Are there any reasons for optimism?

We will examine these and other questions by sampling a selection of popular titles in global health and development. Critically, we will consider the role of the international community—and each of us as world citizens—in contributing to progress. 

We will begin the semester by reading two accounts of life in urban slums. In the first, George Orwell writes a memoir of his experience living on the fringes of society in two of the world's greatest cities in the first half of the 20th century. In the second, Katherine Boo describes live in a modern-day Mumbai slum. 

Next, we will turn to two books that will give us an opportunity to consider guiding frameworks for thinking about the world's problems and society's role in alleviating suffering. In "To Repair the World", we'll read a series of short speeches by Paul Farmer, the well-known doctor and Duke alum. In "Development as Freedom", we'll consider economist Amartya Sen's argument that poverty is the result of one or more "unfreedoms".

Just before Fall Break, we will enter a lively debate about the role of foreign aid in bringing about "The End of Poverty". Economist Jeff Sachs gives us an inspiring look at how we could end extreme poverty by 2025 with enough resources. Could it work? In 2006, Sachs launched the Millennium Villages Project to convince the world. Did it work? Journalist Nina Munk takes us on a critical journey to MVP sites in her book "The Idealist". Between these two bookends we will screen "Good Fortune", a documentary about the recipients of foreign aid in Kenya and the flipside of good intentions.

After the break, we will dive into two books that will examine "what works" on a much smaller, and more easily testable scale. Economists Bill Easterly and Jessica Cohen curate a collection of essays in "What works in Development" from some of the world's most respected scholars. In "Poor Economics", Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, two of the founders of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, review evidence from recent randomized controlled trials and reveal keen insights into the the lives of the poor and suggest steps for turning evidence into action.

In the run up to Thanksgiving, we will turn to public health and humanitarian response. In "Mountains Beyond Mountains", Tracy Kidder brings us back to Dr. Paul Farmer and the inspiring story of Partners in Health. We'll remain in Haiti for Jonathan Katz's award-winning look at what happened (and did not happen) in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake when the world pledged more than 16 billion in aid. We'll also screen our second film, "Living in Emergency", a documentary about the challenging work of Doctors Without Borders.

We will wrap up the semester with Charles Kenny's "Getting Better". We'll ask ourselves whether all of the news is really doom and gloom and consider again the role of the international community in fostering progress.
